You can set min and max dimensions on a grid item by using the \`minW\`, \`maxW\`, \`minH\`, and \`maxH\` properties.

In this demo, the min and max dimensions are generated automatically. Try resizing the items below.

If your mins and maxes collide: for example min > max, or the initial dimensions are out of range, an error will be thrown.
