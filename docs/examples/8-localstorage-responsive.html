           <p>This simple demo synchronizes to localStorage for each responsive breakpoint.</p>
           <p>Try moving and resizing elements, changing window width, moving some more, and refreshing.</p>
           <p>Each breakpoint has a separate layout. The <code>onLayoutChange</code> callback calls back with a hash of breakpoints to layouts, which is then synchronized to localStorage.</p>
